    "## APIs as a Way to Serve Customers\n",

    "Servers can speak directly with clients to perform certain functions, process the request, and then respond with relevant information. It's not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are referred to as microservices.\n"

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Application_** can refer to two definitions in the context of an API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ... a piece of software with a distinct function.\n",
    "- ... the whole server, an entire app, or a small part of an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, any piece of software that can be distinctly separated from its environment can be an application and, thus, have an API so that it can interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Weather Snippets\n",
    "\n",
    "One common API usage example we come across on a daily basis is **_weather data_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich weather snippets are commonplace: Google Search, Apple's Weather app, and even smart home devices. Google isn't in the business of weather data, so this information is sourced from a third party. They do so by means of an API, which sends them the latest weather details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Log In Using XYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of logging-in to users' social media accounts, applications with this functionality leverage Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and/or Google APIs to authenticate the user with each login. Every time the application loads, it uses the API to check if the user is already logged in by means of a social media platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pay with XYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Payment APIs work similarly to those of social media APIs. The payment functionality is built with APIs to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to do without exposing sensitive data or gaining access to unintended permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Travel Booking\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel booking sites aggregate thousands of flights and destinations to showcase the cheapest options. They often use third-party APIs to collect flight and hotel availabilities from providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also allow users to book directly from their application. Travel services make use of APIs to quickly and autonomously exchange both data and requests--in this case, trip availabilities and reservation requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Customer Relationship Management\n",
    "\n",
    "`Salesforce` Platform APIs are the most popular APIs in the world to power CRM needs. The ecosystem is built to be highly customizable, boasting a wide API library and extensive partner marketplace known as `AppExchange`. APIs are pivotal with helping to integrate third-party apps for data backups, form creation, Adobe tooling integration, process automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cloud-Based Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are great for the cloud. They enable developers to design the UI and the backend separately. This is called `headless` development. Decoupling the two allows a service to support multiple platforms, like web, desktop, iOS, or Android with the same backend API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Online Banking\n",
    "\n",
    "The open banking movement, initially spurred by `PSD2`, is maturing. Open banking requires banks in certain geographic zones to open up financial consumer data for third parties to integrate with. These third parties could be financial account aggregators, stock applications, investment portfolios, or even insurance provider dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to screen-scraping, API integration is a safer, more standardized form of financial data integration.\n"

    "## Types of APIs\n",
    "There are three types: `ownership`, `communication`, and `web service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ownership Type\n",
    "- `Open` APIs: These APIs are publicly available to use and generally unrestricted. Also known as `Public` APIs.\n",
    "- `Partner` APIs: These APIs require specific rights or licenses, which are often tied to paid services or subscriptions.\n",
    "- `Internal` APIs: These are developed by companies to use for internal systems. Also known as `Private` APIs.\n",
    "- `Composite` APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication Type\n",
    "- `High-Level`: Often presented in REST form. High-level of abstraction with limited functionality.\n",
    "- `Low-level`: Allows users to manipulate functions within an application module or within hardware at a granular level. Often used to send real-time video or media feed in response to a trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Service Type\n",
    "Web service APIs are classified on their behavioral approach. There are 4 kinds:\n",
    "- `SOAP` Simple Object Access Protocol offers comprehensive security, built-in ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance and retry logic for reliable messaging functionality. Suitable for enterprise applications dealing with banking transactions, LDAP interaction, and more. Uses XML format for transferring structured, function-driven information. For security, SOAP calls cannot be cached and has strict communication protocols that makes it more difficult to make changes and updates.\n",
    "- `XML-RPC` Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Calls is a protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data. Simpler and older than SOAP.\n",
    "- `JSON-RPC` JSON - Remote Procedure Calls is a protocol that uses JSON format to transfer data. RPC calls are one of the methods that are used by services to communicate in a microservice architecture.\n",
    "- `REST` Representational State Transfer is a data-driven architectural style used to build REST APIs. REST APIs are based on URI's (Uniform Resource Identifier) HTTP protocol and uses JSON for data formatting, making it browser-agnostic. REST APIs are also easy to build and scale. REST APIs do not store any state about the client session on the server. This restriction is what makes it stateless. Each request from the client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and it cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server.\n",
    "\n"
   ]

    "## What is REST?\n",
    "> `REST` was defined by Roy Fielding, a computer scientist. He presented the `REST` principles in his PhD dissertation in 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "`REST` depends on two important components:\n",
    "- `client`: a person or software that uses or calls an API.\n",
    "- `resource`: any object the API can provide information about, like a user, a photo, or a hashtag. Each resource has a unique identifier. The identifier can be a name or a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `REST`-ful web application exposes information about itself in the form of information about its resources. It also enables the client to take actions on those resources, such as create new resources or change existing resources. However, a `REST`-ful API is constrained to ensure that it is easy to use and easier to discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `REST` stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. When a `REST`-ful API is called, the server will *transfer* to the client a *representation* of the *state* of the requested resource. The representation of the state can be in a `JSON` format, but it can also be in `XML` or `HTML` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the server does when its called depends on 2 things:\n",
    "1. An identifier for the resource called. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the **endpoint**. Hence, the monicker `Uniform Resource Locator`.\n",
    "2. The operation to perform on that resource, in the form of an `HTTP` method or verb. The common `HTTP` methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`."

    "The constraints:\n",
    "- Uniform interface\n",
    "- Client-server separation\n",
    "- Stateless\n",
    "- Layered system\n",
    "- Cache-able\n",
    "- Code-on-Demand"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Uniform Interface\n",
    "1. The `request` to the server has to include a resource identifier.\n",
    "2. The `response` returned includes enough information so the client can modify the resource.\n",
    "3. Each `request` to the API contains all the information the server needs to perform the `request`, and each `response` returned contains all the information the client needs to understand the response.\n",
    "4. `hypermedia` as the engine of the application site. This refers to the `hyperlinks` or `links` that the server can include in the `response`. This allows the sever to inform the client of the ways to change the state of the web application. This response will include tags with links to other resources as nodes or states\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Server Separation\n",
    "The client and the server act independently. The interaction between them is limited to requests and responses. The server doesn't respond if a request isn't made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless\n",
    "Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesn't have any memory of previous requests, and as such, each request is contextless. But that also means each request must contain all the information the server needs to perform the request and return a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layered System\n",
    "Between the client who requests a representation of a resource's state and the server sending the response back, there may be a number of intermediary servers that provide different functions called layers. This may be security layers, caching layers, load-balancing layers, etc. The layers do not add or subtract from teh request nor the response. The client is agnostic to the layers in both function and quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cache-able\n",
    "The date the server sends contain information about whether or not the data is cache-able. If it is, it may contain versioning. The version number is what makes caching possible. Because the client knows which version of the data it already has, the client can avoid requesting the same data again and again. The client should also know if the current version of the data is expired, in which case the client will know it should send another request to the server to get the most updated data about the state of a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code-On-Demand (Optional)\n",
    "APIs can be REST-ful without providing code-on-demand. The client can request code from the server, and then the response from the server will contain some code, usually in the form of a script when the response is in `HTML` format. The client can then execute the code."
