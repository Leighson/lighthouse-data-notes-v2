    "## APIs as a Way to Serve Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers can speak directly with clients to perform certain functions, process the request, and then respond with relevant information. It's not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are referred to as microservices.\n"

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Application_** can refer to two definitions in the context of an API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ... a piece of software with a distinct function.\n",
    "- ... the whole server, an entire app, or a small part of an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, any piece of software that can be distinctly separated from its environment can be an application and, thus, have an API so that it can interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Weather Snippets\n",
    "\n",
    "One common API usage example we come across on a daily basis is **_weather data_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich weather snippets are commonplace: Google Search, Apple's Weather app, and even smart home devices. Google isn't in the business of weather data, so this information is sourced from a third party. They do so by means of an API, which sends them the latest weather details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Log In Using XYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of logging-in to users' social media accounts, applications with this functionality leverage Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and/or Google APIs to authenticate the user with each login. Every time the application loads, it uses the API to check if the user is already logged in by means of a social media platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pay with XYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Payment APIs work similarly to those of social media APIs. The payment functionality is built with APIs to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to do without exposing sensitive data or gaining access to unintended permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Travel Booking\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel booking sites aggregate thousands of flights and destinations to showcase the cheapest options. They often use third-party APIs to collect flight and hotel availabilities from providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also allow users to book directly from their application. Travel services make use of APIs to quickly and autonomously exchange both data and requests--in this case, trip availabilities and reservation requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Customer Relationship Management\n",
    "\n",
    "`Salesforce` Platform APIs are the most popular APIs in the world to power CRM needs. The ecosystem is built to be highly customizable, boasting a wide API library and extensive partner marketplace known as `AppExchange`. APIs are pivotal with helping to integrate third-party apps for data backups, form creation, Adobe tooling integration, process automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cloud-Based Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are great for the cloud. They enable developers to design the UI and the backend separately. This is called `headless` development. Decoupling the two allows a service to support multiple platforms, like web, desktop, iOS, or Android with the same backend API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Online Banking\n",
    "\n",
    "The open banking movement, initially spurred by `PSD2`, is maturing. Open banking requires banks in certain geographic zones to open up financial consumer data for third parties to integrate with. These third parties could be financial account aggregators, stock applications, investment portfolios, or even insurance provider dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to screen-scraping, API integration is a safer, more standardized form of financial data integration.\n"

    "## Types of APIs\n",
    "There are three types: `ownership`, `communication`, and `web service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ownership Type\n",
    "- `Open` APIs: These APIs are publicly available to use and generally unrestricted. Also known as `Public` APIs.\n",
    "- `Partner` APIs: These APIs require specific rights or licenses, which are often tied to paid services or subscriptions.\n",
    "- `Internal` APIs: These are developed by companies to use for internal systems. Also known as `Private` APIs.\n",
    "- `Composite` APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication Type\n",
    "- `High-Level`: Often presented in REST form. High-level of abstraction with limited functionality.\n",
    "- `Low-level`: Allows users to manipulate functions within an application module or within hardware at a granular level. Often used to send real-time video or media feed in response to a trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Service Type\n",
    "Web service APIs are classified on their behavioral approach. There are 4 kinds:\n",
    "- `SOAP` Simple Object Access Protocol offers comprehensive security, built-in ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance and retry logic for reliable messaging functionality. Suitable for enterprise applications dealing with banking transactions, LDAP interaction, and more. Uses XML format for transferring structured, function-driven information. For security, SOAP calls cannot be cached and has strict communication protocols that makes it more difficult to make changes and updates.\n",
    "- `XML-RPC` Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Calls is a protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data. Simpler and older than SOAP.\n",
    "- `JSON-RPC` JSON - Remote Procedure Calls is a protocol that uses JSON format to transfer data. RPC calls are one of the methods that are used by services to communicate in a microservice architecture.\n",
    "- `REST` Representational State Transfer is a data-driven architectural style used to build REST APIs. REST APIs are based on URI's (Uniform Resource Identifier) HTTP protocol and uses JSON for data formatting, making it browser-agnostic. REST APIs are also easy to build and scale. REST APIs do not store any state about the client session on the server. This restriction is what makes it stateless. Each request from the client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and it cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server.\n",
